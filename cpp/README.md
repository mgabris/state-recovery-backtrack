# RC4 and Spritz state recover backtrack in C++

This directory contains C++ implementations of selected versions of backtrack for both RC4 and Spritz


## Build
To build binaries, invoke

```bash
$ cmake ./ && make
```

in [rc4](./rc4) or [spritz](./spritz) directory.

## Usage

### Generate states
States can be generated by script [generate.py](../python/generate.py) from python part of this repository.

### Test backtrack
Both RC4 and Spritz versions have simmilar usage.

Each variant of backtrack comes with its own binary, accepts state file on stdin and needs 3 positional arguments (this setting is rather simple).

```bash
Usage: ./backtrack [stop after state is found (0/1)] [verbosity] [random keysteam (0/1)] [seed(optional)]
```

Stop after state is found set to 0 forces backtrack to simulate estimate equations situation.

Verbosity 2 prints default statistics about test file.

Random keystream set to 1 use random keystream instead of one generated from input state. Optional seed is integer for random generator.
